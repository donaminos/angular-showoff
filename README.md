# angular-showoff

A presentation tool similar to [Scott Chacon's **Showoff**](https://github.com/schacon/showoff), but built with AngularJS.
As with ShowOff, you write the presentation slides in markdown syntax. But there is no server part, the tool is a full client
web application.

*If you want to use it with Chrome, you must run a web server (Node.js for instance) to serve the files, as Chrome doesn't
allow scripts in a local HTML page to make HTTP requests. Or you can start Chrome with --allow-file-access-from-files flag
to disable this restriction. Firefox has no such restriction.*

[Demo is here.](http://tchatel.github.com/angular-showoff/)
